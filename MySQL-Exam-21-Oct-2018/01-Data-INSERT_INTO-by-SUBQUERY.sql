-- You will have to INSERT records of data into the travel_cards table, based on the colonists table.
-- For colonists with id between 96 and 100(inclusive), 
-- insert data in the travel_cards table with the following values: 
# For colonists born after ‘1980-01-01’, 
-- the card_number must be combination between the year of birth, day and the first 4 digits from the ucn. 
-- For the rest – year of birth, month and the last 4 digits from the ucn.
# For colonists with id that can be divided by 2 without remainder, job must be ‘Pilot’, 
-- for colonists with id that can be divided by 3 without remainder – ‘Cook’, 
-- and everyone else – ‘Engineer’.
# Journey id is the first digit from the colonist’s ucn.
